                        Electromagnetics has not yet reached its full
                        potential for solving problems in the geosciences.
                        However that is changing and today the combination of
                        better field systems and high quality data, advances
                        in scientific computing, and the exponential increase
                        in computer power allows us to solve problems that
                        were not possible a few years ago. It is becoming more
                        common-place to acquire laboratory or in-situ
                        measurements of physical properties and these are
                        essential links in tying the geophysics to questions
                        about the earth. The other advance is the open-source
                        technology associated with the internet which allows
                        technical material and ideas to be generated by
                        multiple contributors through sources like Github. The
                        cloud-based computing environment and advanced
                        software has also opened up portals for interacting
                        with equations and concepts in real time as material
                        is being read. The goal of em.geosci is to blend these
                        items as seamlessly as possible and provide a learning
                        environment in which geoscientists with various
                        backgrounds and expertise can connect with the
                        application of electromagnetics in their field of
                        study. Having a resource that allows participants to
                        answer many different questions connected with
                        electromagnetics will enhance efficiency of research
                        and applications. Moreover, this resource provides an
                        explicit repository for knowledge that has been
                        acquired by practising geoscientists and, when made
                        available, can elevate the learning and responsible
                        use of electromagnetics throughout the communinity.
