                        Solving todayâ€™s geoscientific problems, ranging in
                        scope from resource exploration to environmental
                        management, requires collaboration among scientists
                        from many disciplines: geology, hydrogeology,
                        geophysics, geochemistry, geotechnical engineering.
                        Integration across these disciplines is scientifically
                        and technically challenging because each uses
                        different tools, terminology, methods and workflows.
                        Making sustainable progress in bringing these fields
                        closer together, and working more efficiently within a
                        discipline, is thus a challenge.  We believe that the
                        first step to integration is opening up communication
                        lines - including making knowledge and tools
                        accessible. This is our aim with GeoSci.xyz.

                    <p>
                        We are starting with geophysics. Geophysics has not
                        yet reached its full potential for its contribution to
                        solving problems in the geosciences. However that is
                        changing - today the combination of better field
                        systems and high quality data, advances in scientific
                        computing, and the exponential increase in computer
                        power allows us to solve problems that were not
                        possible a few years ago. It is becoming more
                        commonplace to acquire laboratory or in-situ
                        measurements of physical properties -  these are
                        essential links for integrating  geophysics into the
                        process of addressing questions about the earth.
                        Accessibility to these advances requires that
                        resources: both information and tools, be available to
                        geoscientists. With GeoSci.xyz, we are motivated to
                        lower barriers to entry into geophysics, as such, we
                        are working to build engaging informational resources:
                        Geophysics for Practicing Geoscientists (<a href="http://gpg.geosci.xyz">GPG</a>),
                        Electromagnetic Geophysics (<a href="http://em.geosci.xyz">EM</a>) and connect to
                        software  resources for Simulation and Parameter
                        Estimation in Geophysics (<a href="http://simpeg.xyz">SimPEG</a>). Each component has
                        its own primary development team and an ever-expanding
                        list of contributors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of GeoSci.xyz is to be a portal for
                        information and computational resources for
                        geoscientists. It is modular in design and each
                        component is open-source with content licensed under
                        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/li

                        and hopefully always will be!  We welcome
