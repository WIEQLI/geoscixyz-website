                        The geoscientific problems we are facing, from
                        resource exploration to environmental management will
                        require the integration of information and methods
                        across the geoscience disciplines: geology,
                        hydrogeology, geophysics, geochemistry, and geotechnical
                        engineering. Integrating across these disciplines is
                        a challenging task: each has different terminology,
                        methods and workflows. We believe that the first step
                        to integration is opening up communication lines. This
                        is our aim with <a href="/#home">GeoSci.xyz</a>.

                    <p>
                        We are starting with geophysics. Geophysics has not
                        yet reached its full potential for its contribution to
                        solving problems in the geosciences. However that is
                        changing - today the combination of better field
                        systems and high quality data, advances in scientific
                        computing, and the exponential increase in computer
                        power allows us to solve problems that were not
                        possible a few years ago. It is becoming more
                        commonplace to acquire laboratory or in-situ
                        measurements of physical properties and these are
                        essential links in tying the geophysics to questions
                        about the earth. The other advance is the open-source
                        technology associated with the internet which allows
                        technical material and ideas to be generated by
                        multiple contributors through sources like <a
                        href="http://github.com/ubcgif">Github</a>. The cloud-
                        based computing environment and advanced software has
                        also opened up new ways for interacting with equations
                        and concepts in real time as material is being read or
                        collaborative projects are pursued.

                        The goal of <a href="/#home">GeoSci.xyz</a>
                        is to be a portal for information and computational
                        resources for geoscientists. It is modular in design
                        and each component is open-source with content

                        there are three modules linked with GeoSci.
